### Analysis & Recommendations:

1. The top brands in Super Bowl Commercials are alcohol and consumer packaged goods companies. 
	* Toyota has dominated the space for the Automobile industry, which covers a small portion of the market relatively
2. Doritos has had far more success in YouTube engagement. This finding presents trends for Maven Motors to replicate.
3. By far the top characteristics that are most often paired are "humor" and "showing the product quickly"
  * Seeing that all other big players in the commercial space that sell vehicles are foreign companies, Maven Motors can promote "patriotic" themes

#### Automobile companies average spending 7.2M with average commercial lengths of 53 seconds, both of these are above the average across all industries.
